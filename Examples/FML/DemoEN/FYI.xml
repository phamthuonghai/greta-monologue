			<tm id="tm01"/>
			So the other day my pool filter was broken
			<tm id="tm02"/>
			'so I called the information to get the number of'
			<tm id="tm03"/>
			a pool fixer
			<tm id="tm04"/>
			and wow!
			<tm id="tm05"/>
			When you call the information
			<tm id="tm06"/>
			you talk to a robot.
			<tm id="tm07"/>
			It's a different robot than it used to be 
			<tm id="tm08"/>
			because it was a robot for a while
			<tm id="tm09"/>
			 and now it's a friendlier one. 
			<tm id="tm10a"/>
			That's how bad the economy is, even robots
			<tm id="tm10b"/>
			are getting replaced by other robots
			<tm id="tm11"/>
			The new one is very pleasant, you know, you say the name and the number and she goes,
			<tm id="tm12"/>
			alright, I'll connect you. 
			<tm id="tm13"/>
			It's very very happy, and I've named her Noreen. 
			<tm id="tm14"/>
			The problem with Noreen is that she doesn't understand anything that I say. 
			<tm id="tm15"/>
			Cause at first they say 
			<tm id="tm16"/>
			'city and place, please'
			<tm id="tm17"/>
			so, you know, I say Los Angeles, California. She goes
			<tm id="tm18"/>
			Did you say Los Vilas, California?
			<tm id="tm19"/>
			No I didn't say Los Vilas.
			<tm id="tm20"/>
			Ok, Los Vilas, what listing please?
			<tm id="tm21"/>
			No, Los Angeles, California!
			<tm id="tm22"/>
			Leslie's pools.
			<tm id="tm23"/>
			I start screaming, you know,
			<tm id="tm24"/>
			it's like talking to your Grandma, it's like 
			<tm id="tm25"/>
			'Grandma I got married!',
			<tm id="tm26"/>
			'Did you say I'm getting buried?!'
			<tm id="tm27"/>
			It's so frustrating trying to talk to a robot cause no matter how mad you get, the lady, Noreen, is so calm.
			<tm id="tm28"/>
			I'm having a hard time understanding you, let's try again. 
			<tm id="tm29"/>
			What do you mean let's try again? 
			<tm id="tm30"/>
			And you're finally just like 
			<tm id="tm31"/>
			'I hate you!'
			<tm id="tm32"/>
			 and that's when they've connected you to a real-life person, who knows that you want Leslie's pools, she's in the background listening!
			<tm id="tm33"/>
			And you just think
			<tm id="tm34"/>
			'Are youâ€¦ listening the whole time?
			<tm id="tm35"/>
			Are you just back there? What are you doing?'
			<tm id="tm36"/>
			It's nice when you're a robot, you can't really get mad at the robot or do anything cause it's a robot,
			<tm id="tm37"/>
			so the next time
			<tm id="tm38"/>
			this is what I recommend
			<tm id="tm39"/>
			next time you get pulled over and the cop says 
			<tm id="tm40"/>
			License and registration
			<tm id="tm41"/>
			you just go
			<tm id="tm42"/>
			I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, did you say dices and hesitation?
			<tm id="tm43"/>
			Uh, no, license and registration
			<tm id="tm44"/>
			I'm sorry, let's try that again. Did you say 
			<tm id="tm45"/>
			rice gives indigestion?' 
			<tm id="tm46"/>
			And you just drive off really really fast.
			<tm id="tm47"/>
			The next time I need to find a number I'm gonna do it the old-fashioned way, 
			<tm id="tm48"/>
			I'm gonna make my wife call!
			<tm id="tm49"/>
