# greta-monologue

The repository is the creation of a monologue, which is to be spoken/acted out by Camille, a virtual character of the [Greta](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~pelachau/Greta/) platform, and recorded. Camille is to show a variety of facial expressions and gestures, which are encoded in the FML script, while acting out the monologue.

> Greta is a real-time three dimensional embodied conversational agent with a 3D model of a woman compliant with MPEG-4 animation standard. She is able to communicate using a rich palette of verbal and nonverbal behaviours. Greta can talk and simultaneously show facial expressions, gestures, gaze, and head movements.

The monologue is a part of ['Memorable Monologue: For Your Information'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8nyJcDTjhU) from The Ellen Show by Ellen DeGeneres which was transcribed, shortened, and edited.
